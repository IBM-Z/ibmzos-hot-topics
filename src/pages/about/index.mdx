</PageDescription>

Hot Topics articles are written by the very IBM subject matter experts who design, code, test, document, teach, and support z/OS, and, the articles provide a unique connection between topic experts and the mainframe community and clients who use and are interested in learning more about the IBM Z platform. These articles provide valuable insights that users may be unaware of.

Hot Topics was first published as a printed magazine in 2001 and transitioned to digital articles in 2017. You will find the most recent Hot Topics articles on this site. You can also find these and all previously published Hot Topics articles and magazines (PDF versions) on our archive site [here](https://www-01.ibm.com/servers/resourcelink/svc00100.nsf/pages/zosHotTopics?OpenDocument).

We also included links to other popular sites including [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en) (formally known as the IBM Knowledge Center) and the [IBM Z and LinuxONE content solutions](https://www.ibm.com/support/z-content-solutions/) site where you will find a collection of content solutions on important IBM Z products and functions. A content solution provides a single, engaging place for everything you need to understand and use a product or function.
