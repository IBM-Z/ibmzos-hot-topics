IBM z/OS® 2.4 introduces the ability to run Linux® on IBM Z® software directly on z/OS with IBM z/OS Container Extensions (zCX). 
You can now try zCX on your IBM z14® or IBM z15™ using the 90-day zCX Trial before deciding whether to buy the required priced 
hardware feature code. The trial can be enabled for one or more z/OS systems in a sysplex environment, even if those systems 
are running on different central processor complexes (CPCs).

The zCX Trial grants full zCX capability for a continuous 90 days, allowing you to experiment with the full functionality. 
This is all done without the Container Hosting Foundation hardware feature code. Instead, a software facility will bypass the feature code for the trial duration.

*"When presenting zCX to clients they are very excited about the possibilities that this solution offers. As soon as they get z/OS V2.4 installed in one of their test 
systems they want to start experimenting with zCX. This trial will enable them to quickly try out zCX without needing to go through a lengthy process of approvals, 
purchasing and installing the feature code."  
—Gus Kassimis, Distinguished Engineer, IBM Z Networking and z/OS Container Extensions*

Enable the trial by installing the necessary PTF for APAR OA58969 and editing a z/OS parmlib member. 
You can enable and use the zCX trial without assistance from IBM, by following the [instructions provided in the Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=extensions-zcx-trial). 
The trial documentation also provides all other information for planning, provisioning, and using your zCX instances throughout the trial.

Find resources to help you make the most of your trial, with everything from documentation, tutorial videos, and 
instructions for sample images on the [zCX content solution homepage](https://www.ibm.com/support/z-content-solutions/container-extensions). 
The resources on this page include but are not limited to: 

- Tutorial videos on planning, provisioning, and using a zCX instance
- Instructions and Dockerfiles for sample images in the Ambitus Github
- Blogs and podcasts about zCX capabilities
- IBM Redbooks for getting started with zCX
